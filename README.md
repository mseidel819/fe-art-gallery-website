## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- MUI - For styles
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

My goal in this project is to become more efficient with the MUI library. I'd like to make sure I'm using as much of the library, and as little custom CSS as I can.

I also need help with the coloring of the title in the hero. It uses some sort of effect that I dont know about.
